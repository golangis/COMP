## Implemented optimizations
- Option `-o`:
  - constant propagation
  - constant folding
- Option `–r=<n>` (register allocation):
  - `n ≥ 1`: the compiler tries to use at most `<n>` local variables when generating Jasmin instructions. It aborts and reports an error if `<n>` is not enough to store the local variables.
  - `n = −1`: This is the default value where the compiler uses as many variables as originally present in the OLLIR representation.

## Self-assessment
The developed project seems to be working as expected except for the optimization where the compiler tries to use the fewest registers as possible (option `-r 0`). However, considering that all the project requirements and all the remaining optimizations were implemented, we believe that our project deserves a grade of 19-19.5 out of 20.
